Program Description
My program generates a file that allows someone to create a new habit by making sure that they finish their task everyday. This is because it is widely known that a task, when repeated for a whole month, will start to become a habit. Because this information is written to a file called a "Habit Schedule" the user is able to update it by running the program once per day. At the end of the month, they will see their overall score which is increased when the user does the task and is reduced when they fail to. The user will attempt to get the highest score possible to create a new good habit.
